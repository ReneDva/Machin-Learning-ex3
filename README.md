# Image Classification MNIST with a Convolutional Neural Network

**Description:**
This project evaluated various activation functions for a neural network tasked with MNIST digit classification.
The ELU activation function, combined with batch normalization and progressive dropout, achieved the highest accuracy.
A comprehensive analysis is presented in the accompanying documents.

**Dataset:**
The MNIST dataset is used for training and evaluation.

**Model Architecture:**
A simple neural network architecture with convolutional layers, activation layers, and fully connected layers.

**Results:**
Google sheet containing the experiments and Model evaluation per experiment.
